Codecamy classification AI challenge, for this project I used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Classifiying X-ray images into 3 categories: normal (healthy), Covid-19 infection and Pneumonia.
I got very high accuracy on this one, sometimes a simpler model is better.

Possible users for such algorithm are: healthcare professionals, biomedical researchers, pharmaceutical companies.
